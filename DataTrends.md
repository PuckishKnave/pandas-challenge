Three observable trends in Heroes of Pymoli data:  
1. The ratio of male to female players is overwhelmingly male players coming in at 84.03% compared to a very low 14.06% for the female player base; the remaining player base marked their gender as other/non-disclosed.  
2. Out of the eight age demographics in the dataset there are two age demographics that make up the bulk of the player base. Age range 15-19 was 25.64% and age range 20-24 was 41.67% of the player base; the rest of the age demographics did not exceed 10% of the player base.  
3. The most profitable items in the dataset are not necessarily the most popular ones due to variance in item price.
